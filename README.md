## What is the Purpose of this Application?
As a student, I've often felt like there's a missing bridge between studying from books or online sources and truly understanding a concept. It's essential to have a basic understanding of a concept before diving deeper into it and be mentally prepared for it.
Have you ever found yourself wanting to learn the basics of a concept, like the A* star Algorithm, but got overwhelmed with too much detail all at once? This overload can lead to losing focus, being demotivated, and gaining nothing. If this sounds familiar, then Algorithmic Insight is designed for you. It aims to provide a straightforward understanding of the concepts you're eager to learn.
Algorithmic Insight incorporates the latest Gemini AI from Google, enabling real-time conversations with users. This AI can answer any questions related to computer science topics and even respond to inquiries through image recognition.

## Why would you want to use this Application?
Algorithmic Insight is your guide to gaining a basic understanding of any concept you're curious about. Your AI assistant is always on standby, ready to dive deeper into any topic you wish to explore.
Each lesson you engage has an AI-generated quiz, offering randomized questions every time you participate. The AI then evaluates your performance, providing feedback on how well you understood the material.
With a vast array of lessons at your disposal, if you don't find what you're looking for within the app, simply ask the AI for topic and it will give provide you detailed information on it.
Additionally, the app allows you to effortlessly take notes, bookmark your favorite lessons, and ask the AI for assistance on any topic you'd like. It's your all-in-one tool for expanding your knowledge and mastering computer science concepts.


## Technologies that were used
To develop this app, I utilized React Native for the application structure and Firebase for managing backend services, including storing and retrieving information, user authentication, and storing user media files. I also integrated several other APIs such as React Native Charts for visualization, Markdown API for rendering AI-generated responses into Markdown, and Local Storage and File System API for collecting and caching user media files. To enhance the app's UI/UX, I used the react-native-paper API for styling native components. Last but not least I used syntax-highlighter API which helps to highlight keywords and color the code-block. 

## What’s Next for Algorithmic Insight
Just like any other official software that follows Moore’s law, Algorithmic Insight will also be able to follow that law, which will be by adding new features, enhancing the user experience, user engagement, efficient and reliable code, the code that we can trust on.
Feature that I will be adding is to make this app more interactive, by adding code playground which AI will also be able to assist user in it. User can save their code files as well.
On demand lessons that AI will generate and prepare a lesson for user including quizzes. 
User progress, and performance, time spent, adding lessons of their choice (but will be verified and should follow the pattern of lesson in general).
User should be able to discuss and interact with other users.
And so on by following the law of Moore’s.
